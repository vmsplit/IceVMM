sep 19th:
	got trapping working, now we can try decoding the trap
	reason by reading ESR_EL2 which holds the reason...
	but unfortunately it doesn't hold the key ot my heart

	handle the trap with a dispatcher to find the reason
	and decide the most ILLOGICAL path

	resume guest


	setup interrupt stuff cuz qemu just halts the vCPU
	and also translate guest-phys addrs to host-phys addrs
		(stage-2 translation)
