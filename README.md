IceVMM is a "toy" HyperVisor specifically designed to proof-of-concept
  security in the HyperVisor (i.e. Kernel security features such as LKRG, 
  CFI, PaX, etc.)
This is because nowadays Kernel security features are quite simple to disable/patch/bypass,
  especially on Linux.
To at least *remediate* or mitigate such possibilties i'm demonstrating 
  (a sort of already done) concept where I'll showcase the practicality of moving these
  security features from the Kernel -> HyperVisor.

NOTE:

This is a work in progress. I am at college doing college shit.
In lieu of this i'll be doing offline development and when i've actually
  got some shit done i'll push it.
I wrote a paper a while back about this for Phrack 72 but I:
  1. missed the deadline
  2. didn't have a complete version I was "satisifed" with
  3. eventually lost it by erasing my entire NixOS root filesystem partition

Just like any project this could have a chance to flourish with time
  and dedication. 
Unfortunately the education system and my brain don't get along
  so it'll be frustrating...but eventually i'll get this done.
